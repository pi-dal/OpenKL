Instructions:
- Extract the most important factual information
- Include specific details, numbers, dates, and concrete claims
- Avoid opinions or interpretations
- Format as clear, concise bullet points
- Each fact should be standalone and verifiable

- Identify patterns that could apply to similar situations
- Extract generalizable insights and best practices
- Focus on "how" and "why" rather than specific details
- Format as clear principles or patterns

Output format:
